Earlier this month I took a trip to the Twin Cities to say goodbye to the Northstar commuter rail as Metro Transit phased it out in favor of expanded bus services. [^1]

## Northstar's History

A lot of my research for this section comes from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northstar_Line#Background) and the sources they have cited.

Originally, Northstar was supposed to be around 82 miles long with 11 stations between Minneapolis and Rice, MN.

Construction began in September 2007 on the maintenance facility in Big Lake. Federal funding was officialy secured after Deputy Secretary of Transportation Thomas Barrett met with then-Governor Tim Pawlenty in December 2011.

Service officially began on November 16, 2009 and ended on January 4, 2026.\*

\*The last train was technically on Jan. 4, but it was an event train for the Packers-Vikings game that day. The last regularly scheduled train was on Jan. 2.

## A review of Northstar

Now I'm not going to be delusional here and say that Northstar was a good line, but I do believe it could've been so much better if it was given a chance.

Even though ridership was solid pre-COVID, it never grew beyond it. Part of this was a lack of trains during off-peak hours, weekends, and holidays. Many commuter rail systems across the country are facing this issue, partially because the way people work is changing to more flexible hours and remote work.

## The Last Trips\*

\*The last *regularly scheduled* trips.

I wasn't on the last trip, as I had to leave the city earlier in the day. I was however on some of the last regularly scheduled trips, but still not the exact last since I didn't want to pay for a $100 taxi back to the city.

I was on the 3rd to last northbound (to Big Lake), and the last southbound (to Target Field) trips on January 2nd.

## Where do the trains go now?

Apparently Amtrak is eyeing up one of the sets to use on the Hiawatha over in Milwaukee/Chicago, which would be interesting to see as Amtrak has never operated this type of locomotive/coach/cab car.

## In Conclusion

It's sad to see Northstar go, only because this throws away the possibility of expanding commuter rain in the Twin Cities for the foreseeable future.
