Roblox has always had an issue with predators. It's not a new thing, but those who try to help fix the problem have recently faced consequences from Roblox themself. [^1]

[^1]: Trioli, Virginia (2025-08-29). "[Roblox has booted paedophile hunter Schlep. Who's watching out for the kids now?](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-30/roblox-banned-predator-hunter-schlep-gaming-kids-watching/105711644)". ABC News. Retreived 2025-08-29.

When Roblox faced backlash from banning Youtuber Schlep, who's known for catching predators on the platform, they doubled down on their stance to remove 'vigilantes' from the platform. [^2]

Louisiana's Attorney General has filed a lawsuit against Roblox for creating "an online environment where child sex predators thrive, unite, hunt and victimize kids". [^3] As of the writing of this post, Louisiana is the only state that has done this. (Though Florida's AG has issued subpoenas. [^4])

[^3]: Robinson, Perry (2025-08-14). "[Louisiana sues Roblox, alleging child exploitation and safety failures](https://www.wafb.com/2025/08/14/attorney-general-files-child-protection-lawsuit-against-roblox/)". WAFB. Retreived 2025-08-29.
[^4]: McClellan, Matthew (2025-04-18). "[Florida attorney general subpoenas Roblox over child safety concerns](https://www.fox13news.com/news/florida-attorney-general-subpoenas-roblox-over-child-safety-concerns)". FOX 13 Tampa Bay. Retreived 2025-08-29.

So, what can you do? I'm not one to say what to and what not to do, but you could start with cancelling your Roblox Premium subscription, if you have one. I've decided to boycott Roblox entirely.

**TL;DR:** All of my Roblox-related projects will not receive major updates until meaningful change is made at Roblox.
